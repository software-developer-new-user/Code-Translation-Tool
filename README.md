# Code-Translation-Tool

This is a code translation tool powered by large language models. Gimini developed by Google is used in this project.

It is capable of translating the source code of a programming language to another programming language.

React is used for the frontend and Django is used for the backend.

To run the project, make sure that React and Django have been installed. Replace the Google API key with yours in ./myapp/views.py.
